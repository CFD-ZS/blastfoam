# Two charge detonation tutorial

## Notes

This is a simple case to show how to setup a case using multiple charges. A RDX charge is placed on top of a TNT charge. The top charge is activated when the simulation starts, and the TNT uses a pressure based activation model to simulate how the material activates as the pressure wave passes through the material. This is not a real case, and the activation coefficients are not specific to TNT.

This case takes approximately 3 min to run on a single core desktop.
